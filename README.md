## Introduction
Welcome to my repository, in this repository you shall find a few files which contain functions to generate and modify signals. All of the functions in this repository are written in python. In this README I will explain how to use these afformentioned functions.

## How to use this repository
This repository contains the following:
- a file filled with python functions that describe a few different functions including:
    1. A sine wave function ```generate_sine_wave(frequency, duration, sample_rate```.
    2. A Unit step function ```u(start, finish, amplitude, sample_rate)```.
    3. A function with a modified sine wave function ```modified_sine_wave(frequency, duration, sample_rate, amplitude=1.0)```.
    4. A function with a delayed unit step function ```modified_u(start, finish,delay, amplitude, sample_rate)```.

- a file with functions that run and plot the functions above.

To be able to use this code you should have the numpy and matplotlib modules installed on your computer
